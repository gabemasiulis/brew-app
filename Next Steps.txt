some todo:
- change hop add alerts to a modal (hope to push notifications some day)
- finish formatting the alert message
- make the list of steps clickable to jump to that step and set the timer
- add functionality to add time to a timer without setting a new one.

- add ability to clear all of the data (including the recipe selected)
  - basically dump everything from localStorage.

- add in some recipe "vitals", est OG, FG, actuals, pH, etc.

- add functionality to "upload" files to the recipes directory

- clean up app.py (doc strings!?!)

  timer step concerns:

  - what happens when we set a manual timer after a recipe has been selected?
  - it currently keeps the step label in place, perhaps it should change the label
  to "Manual" or some such. This would require a new function to set the label
  and then call setTimer().
  - We should also have the ability to go back to the main brew timers
  once that is done.
